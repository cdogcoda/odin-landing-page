# odin-landing-page

Hello everyone! Welcome to my second official project! This project is coming from the Odin Project Curriculum right after the basics of CSS Flexbox! After the completion of this project, which will be a simple landing page layout, I should have been able to demonstrate basic proficiency in the following skills: use of growing and shrinking properties of CSS Flexbox, alignment properties of CSS Flexbox (justify-content, align-items, etc), and much more! With that said, thank you so much for visiting this repo and enjoy the project!
